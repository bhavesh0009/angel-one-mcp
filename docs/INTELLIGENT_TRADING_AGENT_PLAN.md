# Intelligent Trading Agent System - Project Plan

> **Project Vision**: Build an autonomous trading agent that can analyze a universe of stocks, make informed trading decisions using technical analysis and news sentiment, and execute trades through Angel One API with comprehensive risk management.

## üìã **Project Overview**

### **Core Objectives (Research-Focused Day Trading)**

- Analyze a CONFIGURABLE universe of stocks with CONFIGURABLE capital
- Focus on 15-minute to 4-hour timeframe strategies (no scalping)
- **MANDATORY**: Close ALL positions before 3:15 PM daily

## üîÑ **Architectural Approach: Hybrid Workflow-Agentic Model**

### **Our Hybrid Approach**

We are adopting a **hybrid model** that combines a structured, auditable workflow with the flexibility of specialized agents. This approach gives us the best of both worlds: the determinism needed for risk management and trade execution, coupled with the adaptability of agents for complex analysis tasks like market research and news sentiment.

### **Core Decision Workflow**

## üéØ **Key Trading Considerations**

### **1. Market Microstructure & Timing**

```yaml
trading_timing:
  avoid_first_15_min: true  # Opening volatility
  avoid_last_15_min: true   # Closing effects
  lunch_hour_caution: 12:00-13:30  # Low volume period
  optimal_windows:
    - 10:00-11:30  # Post-opening stability
    - 14:00-15:15  # Pre-close activity
```

### **2. Correlation & Portfolio Heat Map**

- **Sector Clustering**: Don't trade multiple banks/IT stocks simultaneously
- **Beta Correlation**: In high volatility, avoid multiple high-beta stocks
- **Event Clustering**: Avoid trading before RBI meetings, budget announcements

### **3. Trade Setup Quality Scoring**

```yaml
setup_quality_filters:
  minimum_score: 7/10  # Below this = NO TRADE
  confluence_factors:
    - technical_signals: weight=40%
    - volume_confirmation: weight=20%
    - news_sentiment: weight=20%
    - market_context: weight=20%
```

## üå°Ô∏è **Market Context & Regime Detection**

### **Daily Market Assessment**

```yaml
market_context_check:
  nifty_trend: trending_up | trending_down | sideways
  volatility_regime: low(<15%) | normal(15-25%) | high(>25%)
  market_breadth: bullish(>60%) | neutral(40-60%) | bearish(<40%)
  sector_leadership: IT | Banking | Pharma | Auto | FMCG
  
trade_adjustments:

  sideways_market:
    - prefer_mean_reversion: true
    - avoid_breakout_trades: true
    - target_range_bound_stocks: true
```

### **News & Event Risk Matrix**

| Event Type | Action | Timeframe |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| **Earnings Announcement** | No new positions | Day of announcement |
| **RBI Policy Meeting** | Reduce to 50% capital | Meeting day |
| **Budget/Economic Data** | No trades 1 hour before/after | Event window |
| **Global Market Crash** | Emergency stop all trading | Until stability |
